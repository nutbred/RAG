Originating from Monge’s eighteenth-century formulation (Monge, 1781) and rigorously generalized by Kantorovich in the mid-twentieth century (Kantorovitch, 1958), OT provides a principled way of quantifying discrepancy between probability measures by explicitly modeling the mass displacement required to transform one into another.

Although this structure does not satisfy all properties of classical differen-\\ntial geometry, it provides a powerful first-order calculus for defining tangent spaces, inner products,\\nand components for numerical optimization on the space of probability measures.\\n      Let (μt)t∈[0,1] be a smooth path of probability measures. Its infinitesimal evolution is governed\\nby the continuity equation            d μt + ∇ · (μtvt) = 0,\\n\\n                                      dt\\nwhere vt : Rd         → Rd is a time-dependent velocity field describing the motion of probability mass\\nthrough space. From this dynamical perspective, the tangent space at μ ∈ P2(Rd), denoted as\\nTμP2(Rd), consists of velocity fields that are square-integrable under μ, and arises from gradients\\nof smooth scalar functions. To be precise, it is given by\\n\\n                              TμP2(Rd) := {−∇ϕ : ϕ ∈ C∞(Rd)}L²(μ),\\n                                                         c\\n\\nwhere C∞(Rd) denotes the space of smooth functions with compact support. The minus gradient\\n        c\\nfield −∇ϕ represents a velocity direction along which the measure μ is infinitesimally transported\\naccording to the continuity equation.        These gradients serve as infinitesimal generators of mass-\\npreserving flows and are intimately connected to optimal transport theory, where displacement maps\\nbetween measures arise as gradients of convex potentials. The use of compactly supported smooth\\nfunctions ensures a dense subset for approximation, while the closure in the L2(μ) norm guarantees\\nthat the tangent space includes all square-integrable vector fields that can be approximated in this\\nmanner.

Although this structure does not satisfy all properties of classical differential geometry, it provides a powerful first-order calculus for defining tangent spaces, inner products, and components for numerical optimization on the space of probability measures.\\n\\nLet \\\\((\\\\mu_t)_{t \\\\in [0,1]}\\\\) be a smooth path of probability measures. Its infinitesimal evolution is governed by the continuity equation\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mu_t + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\mu_t v_t) = 0,\\n$$\\n\\nwhere \\\\(v_t : \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\) is a time-dependent velocity field describing the motion of probability mass through space. From this dynamical perspective, the tangent space at \\\\(\\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\), denoted as \\\\(T_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\), consists of velocity fields that are square-integrable under \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\), and arises from gradients of smooth scalar functions. To be precise, it is given by\\n\\n$$\\nT_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d) := \\\\overline{\\\\{-\\\\nabla \\\\phi : \\\\phi \\\\in C_c^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\}}^{L^2(\\\\mu)},\\n$$\\n\\nwhere \\\\(C_c^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\) denotes the space of smooth functions with compact support. The minus gradient field \\\\(-\\\\nabla \\\\phi\\\\) represents a velocity direction along which the measure \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is infinitesimally transported according to the continuity equation. These gradients serve as infinitesimal generators of mass-preserving flows and are intimately connected to optimal transport theory, where displacement maps between measures arise as gradients of convex potentials. The use of compactly supported smooth functions ensures a dense subset for approximation, while the closure in the \\\\(L^2(\\\\mu)\\\\) norm guarantees that the tangent space includes all square-integrable vector fields that can be approximated in this manner.

This re-\\nquires characterizing the gradient of the squared Wasserstein distance functional under the formal\\nRiemannian structure. Specifically, we consider the map\\n\\n                         Fν (μ) = W 2(μ, ν ),                                          (3)\\n                                                2\\nfor  μ, ν ∈ P2(Rd).

We begin by considering a smooth perturbation of μ along a direction −∇ϕ ∈ TμP2(Rd).\\nDefine μϵ := (Id − ϵ∇ϕ)#μ, which is a smooth curve in P2(Rd) for small ϵ > 0. By the differ-\\nentiability of the squared Wasserstein distance along such perturbations (Ambrosio et al., 2005),\\nthe first variation of Fν (μϵ) in ϵ can be computed by pulling back the integral against μ. Writing\\ny = x − ϵ∇ϕ(x), we have dμϵ(y) = dμ(x) up to o(ϵ), while the optimal map Sϵ from μϵ to ν satisfies\\nSϵ(y) ≈ T (x) for ϵ → 0, where T = ∇ψ is the Brenier map from μ to ν .

In Otto’s formal calculus, this space is endowed with a Riemannian-like structure in which the squared Wasserstein distance induces a first-order differential geometry. This requires characterizing the gradient of the squared Wasserstein distance functional under the formal Riemannian structure. Specifically, we consider the map\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\nu(\\\\mu) = W_2^2(\\\\mu, \\\\nu),\\n\\\\tag{3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nfor \\\\(\\\\mu, \\\\nu \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\). Zemel and Panaretos (2019) showed that the Riemannian gradient of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\nu(\\\\mu)\\\\) is \\\\(-2 \\\\log_\\\\mu(\\\\nu)\\\\) given by the logarithmic map. In the following lemma, we reiterate this explicit construction from the formal geometric perspective.\\n\\n**Lemma 3.1.** *Let \\\\(\\\\mu, \\\\nu \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and let \\\\(T = \\\\nabla \\\\psi\\\\) be the unique optimal transport map from \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\), assumed to exist and be unique, for a convex function \\\\(\\\\psi : \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\). The Riemannian gradient of the functional \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\nu(\\\\mu) = W_2^2(\\\\mu, \\\\nu)\\\\) under the formal Riemannian structure on \\\\(\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\) is given by*\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{grad}_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\nu(\\\\mu) = -2 \\\\log_\\\\mu(\\\\nu),\\n\\\\tag{4}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n*where the logarithmic map is defined pointwise by \\\\(\\\\log_\\\\mu(\\\\nu)(x) = T(x) - x\\\\).*\\n\\n**Proof.** We begin by considering a smooth perturbation of \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) along a direction \\\\(-\\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\in T_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\). Define \\\\(\\\\mu_\\\\epsilon := (\\\\mathrm{Id} - \\\\epsilon \\\\nabla \\\\phi)_\\\\# \\\\mu\\\\), which is a smooth curve in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\) for small \\\\(\\\\epsilon > 0\\\\). By the differentiability of the squared Wasserstein distance along such perturbations (Ambrosio et al., 2005), the first variation of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\nu(\\\\mu_\\\\epsilon)\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\epsilon\\\\) can be computed by pulling back the integral against \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\). Writing \\\\(y = x - \\\\epsilon \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x)\\\\), we have \\\\(d\\\\mu_\\\\epsilon(y) = d\\\\mu(x)\\\\) up to \\\\(o(\\\\epsilon)\\\\), while the optimal map \\\\(S_\\\\epsilon\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\mu_\\\\epsilon\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) satisfies \\\\(S_\\\\epsilon(y) \\\\approx T(x)\\\\) for \\\\(\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0\\\\), where \\\\(T = \\\\nabla \\\\psi\\\\) is the Brenier map from \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\). Hence\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\nu(\\\\mu_\\\\epsilon) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\| T(x) - (x - \\\\epsilon \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x)) \\\\|^2 d\\\\mu(x) + o(\\\\epsilon).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nExpanding the integrand yields\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\| T(x) - (x - \\\\epsilon \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x)) \\\\|^2 = \\\\| T(x) - x \\\\|^2 + 2 \\\\epsilon \\\\langle T(x) - x, \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x) \\\\rangle + o(\\\\epsilon).\\n\\\\]\\n', images=[ImageItem(name='page_7.jpg', height=841.89, width=595.276, x=0.0, y=0.0, original_width=1131, original_height=1600, type='full_page_screenshot', rotation=0),

For each measure \\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mu_n = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m_n} w_{n,j} \\\\delta_{x_{n,j}},\\n\\\\]\\nwe solve the discrete optimal transport problem\\n\\\\[\\nW_2^2(\\\\bar{\\\\mu}, \\\\mu_n) = \\\\min_{\\\\Gamma^{(n)} \\\\in \\\\Pi(v, w_n)} \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m_n} \\\\Gamma_{i,j}^{(n)} \\\\| z_i - x_{n,j} \\\\|^2,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(\\\\Gamma^{(n)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m \\\\times m_n}\\\\) is a nonnegative matrix with prescribed row and column sums \\\\(v\\\\) and \\\\(w_n\\\\) respectively. The attained minimizer \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\Gamma}^{(n)}\\\\) represents an optimal transport plan between \\\\(\\\\bar{\\\\mu}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\) according to the Kantorovich formulation.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this does not yield a deterministic map from each \\\\(z_i\\\\) to a point in \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\). The barycentric projection is a standard surrogate that approximates the map by averaging over the support of \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\). For each barycenter point \\\\(z_i^{(k)}\\\\), the projection under \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\Gamma}_n\\\\) is defined as\\n\\\\[\\nT_n(z_i) = \\\\frac{1}{v_i} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m_n} \\\\hat{\\\\Gamma}_{i,j}^{(n)} x_{n,j}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis quantity represents the conditional expectation of the target locations given the transport mass departing from \\\\(z_i\\\\), and hence serves as a continuous proxy for the potentially non-existent Monge map from \\\\(\\\\bar{\\\\mu}\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\). We then define the approximate logarithmic map from \\\\(\\\\bar{\\\\mu}\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\) as the displacement vector\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\widetilde{\\\\log}_{\\\\bar{\\\\mu}}^{(n)}(z_i) := T_n(z_i) - z_i,\\n\\\\]\\nwhich captures the averaged direction and magnitude by which mass should be moved from \\\\(z_i^{(k)}\\\\) to optimally reach \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\) under the plan \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\Gamma}^{(n)}\\\\). We use these projected displacements to approximate the Riemannian gradient of the barycenter functional\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\widetilde{\\\\operatorname{grad}}_{\\\\bar{\\\\mu}} := -2 \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\pi_n \\\\widetilde{\\\\log}_{\\\\bar{\\\\mu}}^{(n)}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nEach step in our optimization will update the barycenter support \\\\(\\\\{z_i\\\\}\\\\) using this approximate gradient, consistent with the Riemannian structure.\\n\\n### 3.2.3 Riemannian gradient update via barycentric projection\\n\\nHaving constructed an approximate Riemannian gradient, we now specify the full iterative update rule to compute the free-support Wasserstein barycenter. Let \\n\\\\[\\n\\\\bar{\\\\mu}^{(k)} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m v_i \\\\delta_{z_i^{(k)}}\\n\\\\]\\nbe the current estimate of the barycenter at iteration \\\\(k\\\\) with fixed weights \\\\(v = (v_1, \\\\ldots, v_m)\\\\). For each \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\), denote the optimal transport plan between \\\\(\\\\bar{\\\\mu}^{(k)}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu_n\\\\) as \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\Gamma}^{(n,k)}\\\\). Under this notation, each support point \\\\(z_i^{(k)}\\\\) is associated with the barycentric projection \\\\(T_n^{(k)}\\\\) and the approximate displacement vector \\\\(\\\\widetilde{\\\\log}_{\\\\bar{\\\\mu}^{(k)}}^{(n)}\\\\) as\\n\\\\[\\nT_n^{(k)}(z_i^{(k)}) := \\\\frac{1}{v_i} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m_n} \\\\hat{\\\\Gamma}_{i,j}^{(n,k)} x_{n,j} \\\\quad \\\\text{and}

The oracle posterior is\\ncomputed analytically, and a full-data MCMC posterior is also computed for baseline comparison.\\nTo approximate, the data are randomly split into K subsets, K ∈ {2, 3, . . . , 20}, each of nearly equal\\nsize. For a fixed K , the k-th subset posterior is fit via MCMC under a power likelihood with an\\nexponent α = n/nk to correct for sample size, where nk is the size of the k-th subset. The resulting\\nsubset posteriors are aggregated into a WASP approximation by computing empirical Wasserstein\\nbarycenters with support sizes varying from 10 to 200. Each configuration is repeated 100 times\\nto quantify Monte Carlo variability. This design enables systematic evaluation of how the number\\nof subsets, stochastic error, and barycenter resolution affect the fidelity of WASP approximations\\nrelative to the oracle posterior.\\nFor posterior sampling, we use the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) (Hoffman and Gelman, 2014) as\\nimplemented in the Stan probabilistic programming language (Stan Development Team, 2025). We\\nrun 4 chains per model, each with 2,000 warmup iterations followed by 20,000 sampling iterations,\\nthinned by 100 and thus retaining 200 posterior draws per chain. A single chain is chosen at random\\nand its samples are used. Diagnostics R and effective sample sizes (ESS) are monitored in that we\\nrequire R < 1.01 for all scalar parameters and both bulk- and tail-ESS ≥ 400.

The oracle posterior is computed analytically, and a full-data MCMC posterior is also computed for baseline comparison. To approximate, the data are randomly split into $$K$$ subsets, $$K \\\\in \\\\{2, 3, \\\\ldots, 20\\\\}$$, each of nearly equal size. For a fixed $$K$$, the $$k$$-th subset posterior is fit via MCMC under a power likelihood with an exponent $$\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{n}{n_k}$$ to correct for sample size, where $$n_k$$ is the size of the $$k$$-th subset. The resulting subset posteriors are aggregated into a WASP approximation by computing empirical Wasserstein barycenters with support sizes varying from 10 to 200. Each configuration is repeated 100 times to quantify Monte Carlo variability. This design enables systematic evaluation of how the number of subsets, stochastic error, and barycenter resolution affect the fidelity of WASP approximations relative to the oracle posterior.\\n\\nFor posterior sampling, we use the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) (Hoffman and Gelman, 2014) as implemented in the Stan probabilistic programming language (Stan Development Team, 2025). We run 4 chains per model, each with 2,000 warmup iterations followed by 20,000 sampling iterations, thinned by 100 and thus retaining 200 posterior draws per chain. A single chain is chosen at random and its samples are used. Diagnostics $$\\\\hat{R}$$ and effective sample sizes (ESS) are monitored in that we require $$\\\\hat{R} < 1.01$$ for all scalar parameters and both bulk- and tail-ESS $$\\\\geq 400$$. Runs failing any criterion are rerun with a higher `adapt_delta` parameter and, if needed, increased iterations. The full-data MCMC baseline is fit with the same settings and thresholds.\\n\\n<table>\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>(A)</th>\\n      <th>(B)</th>\\n      <th>(C)</th>\\n      <th>(D)</th>\\n    </tr>\\n  </thead>\\n  <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\\n        <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123456789/figure3_density.png\" alt=\"Kernel density estimates of posterior distributions\" />\\n      </td>\\n    </tr>\\n<tr>\\n      <td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\\n        Density scale: 40    80    120\\n      </td>\\n    </tr>\\n<tr>\\n      <td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\\n        <span style=\"color:#1f77b4;\">Subset 1</span>   &middot; &bull;   <span style=\"color:#ff7f0e;\">Subset 3</span>    <span style=\"color:#2ca02c;\">Subset 5</span><br/>\\n        <span style=\"color:#d62728;\">Subset 2</span>   &middot; -   <span style=\"color:#9467bd;\">Subset 4</span>    <span style=\"color:#17becf;\">Subset 6</span>\\n      </td>\\n    </tr>\\n  </tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\nFigure 3: Kernel density estimates of posterior distributions.

Notably, the full-data MCMC sample, represented as black dashed lines in the figure, achieves the lowest error for the posterior mean but performs comparatively poorly in covariance recovery, placing it near the worst end of the spectrum across all configurations. In contrast, WASP with sufficiently large support attains smaller covariance error while losing fidelity in mean error by small margins, leading to a lower overall semi-discrete discrepancy. This finding is consistent with what we observed in Figure 3, where the WASP approximation yielded a more smooth, regular posterior shape than the raw MCMC samples. Dependence on the number of subsets $K$ is modest once $K$ exceeds a small threshold. Overall, these results highlight WASP as a reasonable approximation to the oracle posterior, with tangible benefits over both naive subset posteriors and even full-data MCMC in terms of geometric regularity and covariance recovery.', md='Figure 4 summarizes the results.

Figure 8 provides UMAP visualizations for each dataset\\nin R2, colored by the ground-truth labels (McInnes et al., 2020).  For each dataset, we vary the\\npre-defined number of clusters k across a standard range of ±5 from the true k, and report four\\ncommonly used criteria, including adjusted Rand index (ARI) (Rand, 1971), normalized mutual\\ninformation (NMI) (Strehl and Ghosh, 2002), average Silhouette score (Rousseeuw, 1987), and\\nthe Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index (Calinski and Harabasz, 1974).   DVQ results are shown for\\nS ∈ {2, 5, 10} subsets.\\nResults of the experiment are summarized in Figure 9. We first recognize that these algorithms\\nare performing almost equivalently across heterogeneous settings by considering the narrow range\\nof vertical axes in all cases.        On the PBMC dataset, DVQ with large S attains the best ARI\\nand NMI across most k, reflecting its ability to preserve fine cellular structure while denoising\\nthrough subset-level quantization. Silhouette scores decrease mildly with k as expected. When it\\ncomes to the news dataset, DVQ with S = 5 consistently matches spherical k-means in ARI and\\nNMI, indicating that the barycentric prototypes remain relatively competitive in high-dimensional\\nsetting.  A notable pattern is that improvements are most visible for moderate k, where topic\\ngranularity is well captured according to the ground truth.

Originating from Monge’s eighteenth-century formulation (Monge, 1781) and rigorously generalized by Kantorovich in the mid-twentieth century (Kantorovitch, 1958), OT provides a principled way of quantifying discrepancy between probability measures by explicitly modeling the mass displacement required to transform one into another. Beyond its intrinsic geometric and analytic appeal, OT has found an extraordinary breadth of applications across disciplines: in statistics for parameter estimation (Bernton et al., 2019) and hypothesis testing (Ramdas et al., 2017), in machine learning for generative adversarial networks (Arjovsky et al., 2017) and domain adaptation\\\\n\\', images=[ImageItem(name=\\'page_1.jpg\\', height=841.89, width=595.276, x=0.0, y=0.0, original_width=1131, original_height=1600, type=\\'full_page_screenshot\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_text_1_v2.jpg\\', height=124845.931, width=280061.017, x=40773.319, y=495019.821, original_width=894, original_height=282, type=\\'layout_v2_text\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_abstract_1_v2.jpg\\', height=173794.286, width=247683.724, x=57433.953, y=276047.248, original_width=791, original_height=393, type=\\'layout_v2_abstract\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_doc_title_1_v2.jpg\\', height=38877.41, width=232187.29, x=65043.427, y=130562.498, original_width=742, original_height=88, type=\\'layout_v2_doc_title\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_paragraph_title_1_v2.jpg\\', height=9658.041, width=67781.047, x=41826.222, y=470484.646, original_width=217, original_height=22, type=\\'layout_v2_paragraph_title\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_text_2_v2.jpg\\', height=11026.258, width=140106.429, x=111448.817, y=210481.668, original_width=448, original_height=25, type=\\'layout_v2_text\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_aside_text_1_v2.jpg\\', height=305963.936, width=13339.857, x=8560.048, y=200250.912, original_width=43, original_height=691, type=\\'layout_v2_aside_text\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_text_3_v2.jpg\\', height=10869.813, width=39273.304, x=161736.97, y=186765.049, original_width=126, original_height=25, type=\\'layout_v2_text\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_paragraph_title_2_v2.jpg\\', height=9603.925, width=28201.887, x=167805.439, y=257773.448, original_width=91, original_height=22, type=\\'layout_v2_paragraph_title\\', rotation=0), ImageItem(name=\\'page_1_number_1_v2.jpg\\', height=6787.442, width=2848.225, x=180033.11, y=636742.706, original_width=10, original_height=16, type=\\'layout_v2_number\\', rotation=0)], charts=[], tables=[], layout=[LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_text_1_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.98, label=\\'text\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.115, y=0.698, w=0.79, h=0.176), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_abstract_1_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.98, label=\\'abstract\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.162, y=0.389, w=0.699, h=0.245), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_doc_title_1_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.96, label=\\'doc_title\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.184, y=0.184, w=0.655, h=0.055), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_paragraph_title_1_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.92, label=\\'paragraph_title\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.118, y=0.664, w=0.191, h=0.014), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_text_2_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.89, label=\\'text\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.315, y=0.297, w=0.395, h=0.016), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_aside_text_1_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.88, label=\\'aside_text\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.024, y=0.283, w=0.038, h=0.432), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_text_3_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.87, label=\\'text\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.456, y=0.264, w=0.111, h=0.015), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_paragraph_title_2_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.8, label=\\'paragraph_title\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.474, y=0.364, w=0.08, h=0.014), isLikelyNoise=False), LayoutItem(image=\\'page_1_number_1_v2.jpg\\', confidence=0.77, label=\\'number\\', bbox=BBox(x=0.508, y=0.898, w=0.008, h=0.01), isLikelyNoise=False)], items=[PageItem(type=\\'heading\\', lvl=1, value=\\'A Particle-Flow Algorithm for Free-Support Wasserstein Barycenters\\', md=\\'# A Particle-Flow Algorithm for Free-Support Wasserstein Barycenters\\', rows=None, bBox=BBox(x=110.89, y=154.04, w=389.93, h=44.61), html=None, layoutAwareBbox=[{\\'x\\': 109, \\'y\\': 155, \\'w\\': 390, \\'h\\': 46, \\'startIndex\\': 4, \\'endIndex\\': 17}]), PageItem(type=\\'text\\', lvl=None, value=\\'Kisung You¹  \\\\n¹Department of Mathematics, Baruch College\\', md=\\'Kisung You¹  \\\\n¹Department of Mathematics, Baruch College\\', rows=None, bBox=BBox(x=273.55, y=220.14, w=64.12, h=12.31), html=None, layoutAwareBbox=[{\\'x\\': 187, \\'y\\': 250, \\'w\\': 235, \\'h\\': 13, \\'startIndex\\': 15, \\'endIndex\\': 25}, {\\'x\\': 271, \\'y\\': 221, \\'w\\': 65, \\'h\\': 12, \\'startIndex\\': 0, \\'endIndex\\': 6}]), PageItem(type=\\'text\\', lvl=None, value=\\'**Abstract**  \\\\nThe Wasserstein barycenter extends the Euclidean mean to the space of probability measures by minimizing the weighted sum of squared 2-Wasserstein distances.

To briefly describe, when the barycenter is represented by a discrete measure with free support, each atom behaves as a particle that is advected along an averaged OT displacement toward the input measures. To make this tractable, we approximate the maps with barycentric projections of OT plans. The resulting algorithm can be seen as an explicit Euler discretization of the Wasserstein gradient flow, producing an unregularized, geometry-aware flow that preserves sharp features of the barycenter while remaining computationally tractable. The theoretical part of the paper establishes approximation guarantees for barycentric projections, convergence of the proposed free-support scheme, and stability with respect to perturbations of the inputs. On the practical side, we show that the algorithm is efficient to implement, enjoys monotonic descent, and performs well in simulations and real data examples.

Similarly, for \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu, \\\\\\\\nu \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(v \\\\\\\\in T_\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\), the logarithmic map \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\log_\\\\\\\\mu : \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d) \\\\\\\\to T_\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) and the exponential map \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\exp_\\\\\\\\mu : T_\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d) \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) are defined as follows:\\\\n\\\\n$$\\\\n\\\\\\\\log_\\\\\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\nu) := T_{\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\nu} - \\\\\\\\mathrm{Id}, \\\\\\\\quad \\\\\\\\exp_\\\\\\\\mu(v) := (\\\\\\\\mathrm{Id} + v)_\\\\\\\\# \\\\\\\\mu,\\\\n$$\\\\n\\\\nwhich enable one to define geodesics, compute gradients, and construct optimization schemes directly over \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\), mirroring analogous constructions on finite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.\\\\n\\\\nDespite its utility, the Riemannian structure is formal. For the rest of the paper, we abuse the notation \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\log_\\\\\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\nu) = T_{\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\nu} - \\\\\\\\mathrm{Id}\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\exp_\\\\\\\\mu(v) = (\\\\\\\\mathrm{Id} + v)_\\\\\\\\# \\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) in this sense. The space \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) does not possess coordinate charts on a smooth manifold atlas, as tangent vectors are defined indirectly through optimal transport rather than local linearization. When \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) is absolutely continuous and \\\\\\\\(T_{\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\nu}\\\\\\\\) is the unique optimal map, the curve \\\\\\\\(t \\\\\\\\mapsto ((1 - t)\\\\\\\\mathrm{Id} + t T_{\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\nu})_\\\\\\\\# \\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) is the \\\\\\\\(W_2\\\\\\\\)-geodesic from \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\nu\\\\\\\\). Particularly, if \\\\\\\\(v = T_{\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\nu} - \\\\\\\\mathrm{Id}\\\\\\\\), then \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\exp_\\\\\\\\mu(v)\\\\\\\\) is the geodesic endpoint at \\\\\\\\(t=1\\\\\\\\). For an arbitrary \\\\\\\\(v \\\\\\\\in T_\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2\\\\\\\\), the quantity \\\\\\\\((\\\\\\\\mathrm{Id} + v)_\\\\\\\\# \\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) needs not lie on a geodesic, hence we use it only as a first-order Eulerian step within Otto’s formal calculus. In general, key differential geometric tools such as the Levi-Civita connection, curvature tensor, and parallel transport are not available. Moreover, the exponential map may be discontinuous or fail to be invertible, particularly for measures with discrete or singular support.\\\\n\\\\n## 2.3 Wasserstein barycenter\\\\n\\\\nLet \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu_1, \\\\\\\\ldots, \\\\\\\\mu_N \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) be a collection of probability measures with weights \\\\\\\\((\\\\\\\\pi_1, \\\\\\\\ldots, \\\\\\\\pi_N) \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\Delta^{N-1}\\\\\\\\) in the probability simplex, i.e., \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\pi_n > 0\\\\\\\\) for all \\\\\\\\(n \\\\\\\\in [N] := \\\\\\\\{1, 2, \\\\\\\\ldots, N\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\\\\\pi_n = 1\\\\\\\\). The Wasserstein barycenter (Agueh and Carlier, 2011) of this sample is defined as the minimizer of the weighted functional\\\\n\\\\n$$\\\\n\\\\\\\\bar{\\\\\\\\mu} := \\\\\\\\arg \\\\\\\\min_{\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)} \\\\\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\\\\\pi_n W_2^2(\\\\\\\\mu, \\\\\\\\mu_n).\\\\n\\\\\\\\tag{1}\\\\n$$\\\\n\\\\nThis is a direct generalization of the mean from Euclidean space to the space of probability measures by exploiting the characterization of the sample mean as a minimizer of the sum of squared distances. Although its existence is readily guaranteed under mild conditions that all \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\)’s are in \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\), the uniqueness of the Wasserstein barycenter typically requires additional regularity conditions, such as when at least one of \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\)’s is absolutely continuous.\\\\n\\\\nFrom Otto’s formal Riemannian structure of the Wasserstein space, the barycenter satisfies the following stationarity condition (Lanzetti et al., 2025):\\\\n\\\\n$$\\\\n\\\\\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\\\\\pi_n \\\\\\\\log_{\\\\\\\\bar{\\\\\\\\mu}}(\\\\\\\\mu_n) = 0 \\\\\\\\in T_{\\\\\\\\bar{\\\\\\\\mu}} \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d).\\\\n\\\\\\\\tag{2}\\\\n$$\\\\n\\',

Zemel and Panaretos (2019) showed that the Riemannian gradient of \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\\\\\nu(\\\\\\\\mu)\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\(-2 \\\\\\\\log_\\\\\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\nu)\\\\\\\\) given by the logarithmic map. In the following lemma, we reiterate this explicit construction from the formal geometric perspective.\\\\n\\\\n**Lemma 3.1.** *Let \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu, \\\\\\\\nu \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) with \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and let \\\\\\\\(T = \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\psi\\\\\\\\) be the unique optimal transport map from \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\nu\\\\\\\\), assumed to exist and be unique, for a convex function \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\psi : \\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\\\\\to \\\\\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\). The Riemannian gradient of the functional \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\\\\\nu(\\\\\\\\mu) = W_2^2(\\\\\\\\mu, \\\\\\\\nu)\\\\\\\\) under the formal Riemannian structure on \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) is given by*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\n\\\\\\\\mathrm{grad}_\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\\\\\nu(\\\\\\\\mu) = -2 \\\\\\\\log_\\\\\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\nu),\\\\n\\\\\\\\tag{4}\\\\n\\\\\\\\]\\\\n\\\\n*where the logarithmic map is defined pointwise by \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\log_\\\\\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\nu)(x) = T(x) - x\\\\\\\\).*\\\\n\\\\n**Proof.** We begin by considering a smooth perturbation of \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) along a direction \\\\\\\\(-\\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\phi \\\\\\\\in T_\\\\\\\\mu \\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\). Define \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu_\\\\\\\\epsilon := (\\\\\\\\mathrm{Id} - \\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\phi)_\\\\\\\\# \\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\), which is a smooth curve in \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{P}_2(\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d)\\\\\\\\) for small \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\epsilon > 0\\\\\\\\). By the differentiability of the squared Wasserstein distance along such perturbations (Ambrosio et al., 2005), the first variation of \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\\\\\nu(\\\\\\\\mu_\\\\\\\\epsilon)\\\\\\\\) in \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\) can be computed by pulling back the integral against \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\). Writing \\\\\\\\(y = x - \\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\phi(x)\\\\\\\\), we have \\\\\\\\(d\\\\\\\\mu_\\\\\\\\epsilon(y) = d\\\\\\\\mu(x)\\\\\\\\) up to \\\\\\\\(o(\\\\\\\\epsilon)\\\\\\\\), while the optimal map \\\\\\\\(S_\\\\\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\) from \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu_\\\\\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\nu\\\\\\\\) satisfies \\\\\\\\(S_\\\\\\\\epsilon(y) \\\\\\\\approx T(x)\\\\\\\\) for \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\to 0\\\\\\\\), where \\\\\\\\(T = \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\psi\\\\\\\\) is the Brenier map from \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\nu\\\\\\\\). Hence\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\n\\\\\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\\\\\nu(\\\\\\\\mu_\\\\\\\\epsilon) = \\\\\\\\int_{\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\\\\\| T(x) - (x - \\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\phi(x)) \\\\\\\\|^2 d\\\\\\\\mu(x) + o(\\\\\\\\epsilon).\\\\n\\\\\\\\]\\\\n\\\\nExpanding the integrand yields\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\[\\\\n\\\\\\\\| T(x) - (x - \\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\phi(x)) \\\\\\\\|^2 = \\\\\\\\| T(x) - x \\\\\\\\|^2 + 2 \\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\langle T(x) - x, \\\\\\\\nabla \\\\\\\\phi(x) \\\\\\\\rangle + o(\\\\\\\\epsilon).\\\\n\\\\\\\\]\\\\n\\',

For each subproblem, there exist efficient solvers such as network simplex\\\\n(Bazaraa et al., 2010), or even approximation of such if entropic regularization is allowed (Cuturi,\\\\n2013). The quality of initialization is significant for such a nonconvex optimization. We conjecture\\\\nthat the barycenter of multiple probability measures should reflect the overall shape of the union\\\\nof these measures.

For measures with well-separated modes or strong symmetry, local minima can be informative prototypes in unsupervised settings.\\\\n\\\\nWe offer a few remarks on implementation. The optimal transport plan \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\Gamma^{(n,k)}\\\\\\\\) must be calculated in each iteration between the current barycenter \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\bar{\\\\\\\\mu}^{(k)}\\\\\\\\) and each input measure \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\). This accounts for solving multiple standard linear programs over the product of simplices independently, which can be done in parallel. For each subproblem, there exist efficient solvers such as network simplex (Bazaraa et al., 2010), or even approximation of such if entropic regularization is allowed (Cuturi, 2013). The quality of initialization is significant for such a nonconvex optimization. We conjecture that the barycenter of multiple probability measures should reflect the overall shape of the union of these measures. In line with this reasoning, we propose to use the *k*-means centers of all pooled support points from \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\).

By recognizing the equivalent forms of the error \\\\\\\\(E_m\\\\\\\\), this completes the proof. □\\\\n\\\\nLemma 4.1 provides a theoretical justification for using barycentric projections as an approximation to the Riemannian gradient in Wasserstein space. It shows that, as the empirical input measures become dense enough, the approximate gradient computed from the transport plans converges to the true gradient direction in \\\\\\\\(L^2\\\\\\\\) sense. This result directly connects to the known results on the convergence of the barycentric projections of optimal transport plans to the Monge map under suitable conditions (Peyré and Cuturi, 2019). In our setting, it means that updating the barycenter using these projections remains consistent with the true gradient flow, making the discrete algorithm a reliable approximation of the continuous Wasserstein gradient descent. This convergence provides an effective approximation of the continuous gradient flow, ensuring that the algorithm maintains its reliability in large-scale computations and empirical settings.\\\\n\\',

Larger barycenter supports consistently reduce error, particularly for the covariance and the Wasserstein discrepancy. This pattern mirrors our earlier simulation, with location estimates remaining relatively stable and covariance driving most of the variation in accuracy.

In contrast, WASP with sufficiently large support attains smaller covariance error while losing fidelity in mean error by small margins, leading to a lower overall semi-discrete discrepancy. This finding is consistent with what we observed in Figure 3, where the WASP approximation yielded a more smooth, regular posterior shape than the raw MCMC samples.

As \\\\\\\\( n \\\\\\\\) increases, stroke geometric structure is resolved. (B) Corresponding kernel density estimates with overlaid contours. Internal holes and stroke thickness become well defined by \\\\\\\\( n = 80 \\\\\\\\), with finer structure visible at \\\\\\\\( n = 160 \\\\\\\\).\\\\n\\\\nVisual quality seems to improve monotonically with \\\\\\\\( n \\\\\\\\) up to moderate resolutions. With \\\\\\\\( n = 10 \\\\\\\\), the barycenter already sketches the digit’s skeleton but can be visually ambiguous. At \\\\\\\\( n = 40 \\\\\\\\) to 80, the canonical shape of the two holes of an “8” is stably recovered. Beyond that, it further thickens strokes and begins to place particles in regions that reflect intra-class variability and some degree of occasional noise.\\\\n\\\\nFor classification, we draw an independent set of 2,500 images with approximately balanced labels. Each test image is preprocessed in the same way and then assigned to the nearest class prototype with respect to the \\\\\\\\( W_2 \\\\\\\\) distance (Manning et al., 2008). We report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 as functions of \\\\\\\\( n \\\\\\\\) as shown in Figure 7. Classification exhibits a similar pattern of early gain and plateau. All metrics achieve their highest peak near \\\\\\\\( n \\\\\\\\approx 40 \\\\\\\\), remaining relatively stable thereafter.

The standard k-\\\\nmeans algorithm (MacQueen, 1967) is a foundational baseline in cluster analysis with drawbacks\\\\nin terms of memory- and time-demanding nature on large datasets. We therefore consider a dis-\\\\ntributed vector quantization (DVQ) scheme inspired by classical vector quantization Gray and\\\\nNeuhoff (1998): (1) split the dataset into         S non-overlapping subsets, (2) compress each subset\\\\nto a 10% summary by running a k-means clustering with the corresponding number of centroids\\\\n(Kreitmeier, 2011), and (3) cluster the union of subset summaries by running the proposed free-\\\\nsupport barycenter solver with k support points, which serve as DVQ centroids.

DVQ results are shown for\\\\nS ∈ {2, 5, 10} subsets.\\\\nResults of the experiment are summarized in Figure 9. We first recognize that these algorithms\\\\nare performing almost equivalently across heterogeneous settings by considering the narrow range\\\\nof vertical axes in all cases.        On the PBMC dataset, DVQ with large S attains the best ARI\\\\nand NMI across most k, reflecting its ability to preserve fine cellular structure while denoising\\\\nthrough subset-level quantization. Silhouette scores decrease mildly with k as expected. When it\\\\ncomes to the news dataset, DVQ with S = 5 consistently matches spherical k-means in ARI and\\\\nNMI, indicating that the barycentric prototypes remain relatively competitive in high-dimensional\\\\nsetting.  A notable pattern is that improvements are most visible for moderate k, where topic\\\\ngranularity is well captured according to the ground truth.
